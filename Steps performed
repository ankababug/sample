Steps performed
1. Installed Docker for Mac
2. Tested the installation by importing public Docker images for sample applicatation nginx. It worked
3. Created a new folder called mydocker2
4. Inside the folder mydocker2, created a Dockerfile file and added below lines
  FROM ggtools/java8
  MAINTAINER gopaldk@gmail.com
  CMD java -jar landing.jar
  ADD landing.jar landing.jar
 5. PAsted the executable java jar inside the folder 'mydocker2'
 6. executed the docker command within the folder 'mydocker2'
    docker build -t first-docker-img
 7. After successful build the command docker ps will show like below
    ONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
6dfbabeb328a        first-docker-img    "/bin/sh -c 'java -ja"   27 seconds ago      Up 25 seconds                           happy_kalam    

8. triggered run command
   docker run first-docker-img
9. I can see the same command line entries as I get when I execute the java -jar command without docker.
10. I tried to test my executable by going to browser and typing localhos:8080/com.kalp.land
IT WONT work
